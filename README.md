# l33t
 
CSP1150 Project
project is a text replacement program, which converts inputs into their 'l33t' version.
It only encodes/decodes specific letters and ignores any other symbols.
Output of the program is stored in 'data.txt', a file that will be created automatically if it is not already present.
